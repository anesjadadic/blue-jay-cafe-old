# blue-jay-cafe

Blue Jay Cafe is fictional and purely serves as a topic for my website mockup project.

This program serves to showcase some of my knowledge with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

All scripts are internal, contained within some of the HTML files. 
There is an external CSS stylesheet but there are plenty of internalstyle modification as well.
